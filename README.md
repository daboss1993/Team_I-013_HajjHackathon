## Inspiration
Death accidents that happened in Mina

## What it does
The idea is to design a suitable system that receives a sensor data from a specific area (Mina for example) which will calculate the number of Pilgrims walking through the sensor. The main objective to have the number of pilgrims and save it in a cloud in order to enable the AI Apps from getting those data and transfer it into useful information. As a first step, an automatic control system will control and manage pilgrims crowds in normal and emergency time. 

## How we built it
Using a web-page interface to show the data from the sensor and to have the system count the number of pilgrims in that area for a start. The system has algorithms belt into it that expect certain streets to be crowded before they become crowded.

## Challenges we ran into
Implementing the system and building the algorithms 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Managing crowds through footsteps and Advance control systems

## What we learned
How to integrate ideas into one useful idea.

## What's next for Tracking System 300
Use big data, IoT, and scheduling in our systems.
